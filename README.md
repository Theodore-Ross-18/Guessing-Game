# Guessing-Game

An Enhance Guessing Game using Python Programming Language with the utilization of Sockets and additional features of the following:

1. user/client can repeat the game without disconnecting

2. user can choose difficulty based on the generated random number to guess

  a. easy (1-50)
  b. medium (1-100)
  c.hard (1-500)

3. the game implements a scoring mechanism based on the number of tries the user guesses the number to guess (less tries the better), and provide a leaderboard containing the name of the user and her/his score which is displayed after the user/client disconnects from the server.

4. persistence - the server should save the user's name, his/her score, and the last chosen difficulty (should default to easy) into a file and this file will be loaded/updated during leaderboard display and when the user set's the difficulty.
